# fuckbrain

A [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in Java.

## Usage

- Website

    **NOTE**\
        My website is currently not up at this time; clicking that link will give you a dns error. Once the website is up-and-running, I will remove this note. Another thing to note is that the code is not on
        this repository because I am still building the website. Once the website is up, I will add a file called `WEBLINK` that is just a link to the code for this project on my website repository.\
    **END NOTE**
 
    qque.io/fuckbrain. 

- Main.java

    In ./src/fuckbrain/, you can run Main.java and it will ask info on the parameters. The main issue with this method of using fuckbrain is that you need to have java installed, have it working without bugs, and you
    have to use a command line. So I don't really recomend using this implementation.

That's it, a very simple project that I wanted to roll out as I have been working on massive projects that take an insane amount of time to complete for one person.\
